> **Note:** In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

> **Important:** Always use `bun` instead of `npm` or `yarn` for installing dependencies and running TypeScript/Node commands.

> **Important:** After making code changes, always validate with `bun run lint`, run all tests and `bun tsc --noEmit` inside the package to catch errors early (if applicable).
